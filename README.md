# FM Clock Radio Project ![Powered By Arduino](https://img.shields.io/badge/Powered%20By-Arduino-blueviolet)

In this repo, we provide some information and documents that may be useful for your FM clock radio project. The information is served as a starting point, you are encouraged to look for more information on the Internet.

You can find the components that you'll receive in the shopping list document [here](https://github.com/cfoh/FM-Radio-Project/blob/main/FM%20Radio%20-%20Shopping%20List.pdf).

**IMPORTANT**: In this project, it is not our intention to provide full information nor easy-to-follow step-by-step instructions. In the real world, you always need to find information yourself and check the accuracy of the information.

To help you get started with the project, we have provided some test code for **selected components**. You can use the test code to test the functioning of the components and learn how to control them.
